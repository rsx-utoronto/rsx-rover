# Robotics for Space Exploration (RSX)

## What is RSX?

Robotics for Space Exploration (RSX) is the University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering’s affiliated Mars Rover design team. 
RSX designs, builds, and competes with Mars Rovers in international competitions, such as the University Rover Challenge, European Rover Challenge, and Canadian International Rover Challenge. 
RSX was formed in 2013 by passionate roboticists, space enthusiasts, and undergraduate students. RSX challenges students to be innovative, striving to push boundaries in extraterrestrial exploration. We encourage students to learn about, experiment with, and develop proficiency in engineering technology, and promote growth through hands-on experience. 

For us, the sky is not the limit – it’s just in the way.
