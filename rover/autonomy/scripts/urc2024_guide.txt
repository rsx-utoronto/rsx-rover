Electrical Set-up: 
    1. Rover battery should be plugged in and adequately charged (Approx 16 V). BMS should shut off rover if power low (under 13.6 V)
    2. AMD should have
        i. power supplied
        ii. ublox GPS plugged into USB3 port (blue port)
        iii. Ethernet connected to the Network Switch
    3. Jetson should have
        i. power supplied
        ii. ZED camera plugged in
        iii. Ethernet connected to the Network Switch
    4. Mast Camera should have
        i. power supplied (12 V **double check)
    5. Network Switch should have 
        i. AMD, Jetson, as above
        ii. TP Link (LAN)
    6. TP Link 
        i. Network Switch in (LAN), as above
        ii. Antenna ethernet (POE)
        iii. Barrel connector (red and black) with label POE plugged into DC



Communication Set-up:
    Power the base station antenna (outlet) 
    The AP should show a green light initially 
    Connect the ethernet cable to the base station laptop
    Make sure a profile exists on the computer in the 
    Once communication with the rover antenna has been established, all the bars on the AP will turn on  
    Power on the rover 
    All motors should be flashing red, the AMD power button lit up, and the jetson have a green light 
    Check that the bars on both APs turn on fully 

Start up Software 
    1. Open an SSH connection:
        a. Need to open a connection to the amd in a terminal using ‘ssh amd’ and in another terminal to the jetson with ‘ssh jetson’
        b. Alternative is to open a connection with vs code by clicking the blue button in the bottom left corner, then in the drop down click on ‘Connect to Host…’ and then ‘jetson’/’amd’.
    2. Base Laptop: Make sure you have set the base laptop to have the AMD as master 
    In terminal do this with the two commands ‘setip’ and ‘setmaster’ (if this does not work follow the below)
    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.0.99:11311
    export ROS_IP=192.168.0.{base laptop address} (20 for thinkpad 45 for dell) - note that you will need to create a profile with: 
        a. Select manual 
        b. Ip in the above format with a number between 1 and 255 as the last digits 
        c. A mask 255.255.255.0 
        d. You may also need to add your laptop in the /etc/hosts file on both the base laptop and NUC to allow proper ROS networking 
    3. On the AMD run ./setup_can.sh to set up the motors 
        ./rover_ws/src/rsx-rover/scripts/utils/gen/setup_can.sh
        **USB** to check which usb port is connected, do ./rover_ws/src/rsx-rover/scripts/utils/gen/find_usb.sh
    4. (Optional) To check CAN lights, check CAN communication with the following commands in amd terminal
        a. cansend can0 999#DEADBEEF 
        b. candump can0 
        c. A stream of info should be showed to show communication and the lights on the motors will flash orange.
    5. (Error) If the motor lights flash green:     
        a. Turn on and off the AMD. If this fails,
        b. Power cycle the rover
        c. Ask electrical what's up?
    6. Launch the motors on AMD
        roslaunch rover falcons.launch 
    7a. (Manual) To start the manual drive 
        a. On base laptop (with controller connected) run command ‘roslaunch rover joy.launch’
        b. On AMD run command ‘rosrun rover drive_sender_node’
        c. If you aren’t getting input try restarting the joy node, also check its publishing with ‘rostopic echo software/joy’
    7b. (Autonomy) This is suspicious.
        a. On AMD run command 'roslaunch rover move_base.launch'.
        b. **Check move base documentation below.
    8. (GPS) To run GPS, ensure that the GPS USB says ublox on it. It must be plugged into a blue port on the AMD (USB3). 
        a. Run on AMD 'roslaunch rover ublox.launch'. 
        b. To see what it is printing, run 'rostopic echo ublox/fix'
    9. Launch the ZED camera 
        a. On the Jetson run command ‘roslaunch rover zed_odom.launch’
        b. To check camera feed open rviz on the base laptop and check the topic ‘zed_node/image_rect_colour/compressed’
        c. On Jetson to run odometry ‘roslaunch rover rtabmap_zed.launch’

Ignore for now the following
    In the rover_ws/src/rsx-rover/scripts/utils/comms/nuc_comms_check.py file, go to line 12 and change the base_ip to the base station’s ip
    Launch the state machine
        roslaunch rover state_machine.launch
    Base Laptop: Connect two controllers to the base laptop
    Base Laptop: Launch the GUI and joy on your base laptop 
        roslaunch rover joy.launch
            Change the mode from Idle to Manual in the GUI for manual control
        You can echo the joy topic on the NUC to make sure it is communicating and check which controller is for arm and which one is for software.
    Launch sensors 
        roslaunch rover sensors.launch
    To run move base 
        roslaunch rover move_base.launch
