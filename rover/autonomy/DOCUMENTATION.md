# Straight Line Traversal

## PID
### Straight line traversal using just P 

The rover goes to the goal and stops but while turning it is giving jerks because it's getting alternate linear/angular velocity and zero velocity - **This problem is fixed**

### Full PID

- The rover rotates on spot, moves slightly forward, the does a full rotation again and continues
- Gives jerks because it's getting alternate linear/angular velocity and zero velocity - **This problem is fixed**
